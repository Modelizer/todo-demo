## Todo List Demo

#### Technical notes:
- Inertia is used. Therefore, entire project is working as SPA.
- This project does not consist of Create, Update and Delete commands. As it was difficult to 
visualise how such commands will be possible on Fake external API.

#### Installation setup.
- Git clone `git clone https://github.com/Modelizer/todo-demo.git`
- Make sure `.env` file is present.
- Run `composer install`
